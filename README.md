spinup
======
Simple server spinup example using Pyrax and a yaml definition file
 - Define server type
 - Define count
 - Define simple test criteria
 - Delete if failed
 - Generate statistics

Requirements:
 - Tested on Python 2.7
 - See requirements.txt for python modules

Arguments:

--help     : This help

--username : Rackspace Cloud username.This also can be read from the environment variable OS_USERNAME 

--apikey   : Rackspace Cloud API key. This also can be read from the environment variable OS_PASSWORD 

--region   : Rackspace Cloud region(ord,iad,lon,syd,hkg). This also can be read from the environment variable OS_REGION 

--template : YAML template (use --templatehelp for more details)

--templatehelp : Print detailed template help

YAML template file explained :-

```
log_file: Log file for operations
log_level: Log level

creds:
  username: Rackspace Cloud username. This also can be read from the
  environment variable OS_USERNAME or passed via the command line using
  --username.

  api_key: Rackspace Cloud api key. This also can be read from the
  environment variable OS_PASSWORD or passed via the command line using
  --apikey.

  region: Rackspace Cloud region(ord,iad,lon,syd,hkg). This also can be
  read from the environment variable OS_REGION or passed via the command
  line using --region.

server:
  image_id: Rackspace cloud server image ID.

  flavor_id: Rackspace cloud flavor ID.

  sshkey_name: SSH key if server type is Linux.

  tests: Define the tests that need to be performed for determining the
  sucess of the server build.

  ports: Comma separated list of ports. These ports will be scanned to make
  sure they are listening.

  url: A URL that can be used to check heath status. e.g. /health.php

  url_sha1:  A SHA checksum for the URL.

  retries: Number of times to try the tests.

  build_timeout: Number of seconds to wait before treating the server as
  failed. If the server is not active by then, it will be deleted.

  total_timeout: A grand total timeout after which the scripts aborts.

  check_interval: Intervals to check server status during the build process.
  If you set this too low, you may hit API limits.

  desired_count: Number of servers desired

  error_prediction_pct: An estimation of how many servers will fail the build.
  This is used to calculate the number of servers to start with. The values
  are rounded to the nearest integer.

  delete_failed: Delete servers that we consider failed. This includes the
  servers that took longer than build_timeout.

  delete_success: Delete servers in any case. Used for testing and playing.

  rackconnect: Are these servers rackconnected.

  stats_file: A file to which CSV results will be written.

```
